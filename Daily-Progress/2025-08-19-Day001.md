## 🚀 Code Written Today

```python
# My very first Python program!
print("Hello, MIS Engineering World!")
print("My name is Odili Chinedum Christian")
print("Today I begin my 12-month journey to become a Software Engineer and Data Analyst!")

# Basic arithmetic
days_in_journey = 365
hours_per_week = 15
total_learning_hours = (days_in_journey / 7) * hours_per_week
print(f"Total learning hours planned: {total_learning_hours:.0f} hours")
```
