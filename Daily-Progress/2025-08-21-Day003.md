## 🎯 Today's Learning Goals

### Phase 1, Month 1, Week 1, Day 3: "Think like a program: Decision Making!"

#### Morning Session (08:50-11:50): ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Understanding if, elif, else statements
- [x] Practice comparison operators(==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- [x] Performing logical operations (and, or, not)
- [x] Create a BMI classifier program
- [x] Build a personal information display program

#### Evening Session (21:46-22:00): ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Push grade_classifier.py and bmi_advisory.py to GitHub
- [x] Update daily log and reflection
- [x] Plan tomorrow's focus: Loops (for, while)
- [x] Confirm all files are committed and README is updated

## 💡 What I Learned Today

1. **Control flow is the brain of a program:** It makes decision based on data.
2. **Indentation matters in Python:** No braces, just clean, readable blocks..
3. **elif prevents multiple checks:**Efficient and clean logic flow.
4. **Logical operators combine conditions:** and, or, not unlock complex decisions
5. **Real-world apps use conditionals everywhere:** From login checks to grading systems.

## 🚀 Code Written Today

```python
# grade_classifier.py
# classify grades based on score

score = 87

print("=== GRADE CLASSIFIER ===)
print(f"Score: {score}")

if score >= 90:
  grade = "A"
  remark = "Excellent"

elif score >= 80:
  grade = "B"
  remark = "Very Good"

elif score >= 70:
  grade = "C"
  remark = "Good"

elif score >= 60:
  grade = "D"
  remark = "Fair"
elif score >= 50:
  grade = "E"
  remark = "Pass"
else:
  grade = "F"
  remark = "Fail"

print(f"Grade: {grade}")
print(f"Remark: {remark}")

```
```python
# bmi_advisory.py
# calculate BMI and provide health advice

height = 1.75
weight = 70

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

print("=== BMI ADVISORY ===")
print(f"Height: {height} meters")
print(f"Weight: {weight} kilograms")

if bmi < 18.5:
  category = "Underweight"
  advice = "Eat more nutritious meals."

elif bmi < 25 and bmi >= 18.5:
  category = "Normal Weight"
  advice = "Keep up the healthy lifestyle!"

elif bmi < 30 and bmi >= 25:
  category = "Overweight"
  advice = "Consider losing some weight."

else:
  category = "Obese"
  advice = "Seek medical advice."

print(f"BMI Category: {category}")
print(f"Advice: {advice}")

```

## 🏆 Achievements Unlocked

- 🎯 **Decision Maker** - Mastered if, elif, else logic!
- 🔢 **Logical Thinker** - Used and, or, not in conditional checks
- 📟 **Real-World Builder** - Created working programs for grading and health
- 🐍 **Clean Code** - Proper indentation, meaningful variable names
- 📚 **Two Projects Added** - Created `grade_classifier.py` and `bmi_advisor.py` scripts
- 🌐 **GitHub Synced** - All new code pushed with clear commit messages
- 📊 **Progress Tracking System** - Daily and weekly trackers operational
- 🔥 **Streak Maintained** - 3 days strong! Consistency is building

## 🧠 Reflections & Notes

- **What went well:** The BMI program felt like a real application  - useful and logical
- **What challenged me:** Forgetting parentheses in  `height_m**2` - Caused wrong BMI!
- **Tomorrow's focus:** Loops (for, while) - Automating repetitions
- **Motivation level:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (5/5) - Seeing real programs work is addictive!, feeling progress!

---

## 📈 Progress Metrics

- **Hours studied today:** 3 hours
- **GitHub commits:** 3 commits (added two new scrips  + log update) ✅
- **Lines of code:** 60+ lines (clean and documented)
- **Files created:** 3 (grade_classifier.py, bmi_advisory.py, 20205-08-21.md )
- **Concepts learned:** Coditional logic, comparison operators, logical operators, indentation rules
- **Current streak:** 3 day 🔥

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan (Day 004)

### Loops: Automating Repetitions

- **08:50-11:50:** Learning and practicing for and while loops
- **Tasks:**
  - Use break, continue, pass in loops
  - Build a multiplication table generator
  - Create a number guessing game (basic version)
- **Evening:** Push code, reflect, plan functions for Day 005
- **Project:** Build a simple personal information display program
