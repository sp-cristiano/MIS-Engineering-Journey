# Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types
# Learn how to store and work with data in Python

# =============================================================================
# VARIABLES - containers that store data values
# =============================================================================

# Creating variables (no need to declare type - Python figures it out!)
name = "Odili Chinedum Christian"     # String (text)
age = 25                              # Integer (whole number)
height = 5.9                          # Float (decimal number)
is_learning_python = True             # Boolean (True/False)
computer_name = "Voldamort"

# Display variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height, "feet")
print("Learning Python:", is_learning_python)
print("Computer:", computer_name)

print("\n" + "="*50)
