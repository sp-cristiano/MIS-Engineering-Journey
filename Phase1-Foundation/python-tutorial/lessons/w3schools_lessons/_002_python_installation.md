# PYTHON INSTALLATION

Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.
To check if you have python already installed, input this command in your terminal:

```bash
$ python --version
```
![show python version](../../../src/images/python_version.png)

if you have python installed you will see the version of the python that has been installed but if not, you can go to [Python official website](https://www.python.org/), follow the instructions there to get python installed and setup for free.
