# PYTHON QUICKSTART

Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python(.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

## Lets write our first Python program that greets the world.

```hello.py
print('Hello World!')
```

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
